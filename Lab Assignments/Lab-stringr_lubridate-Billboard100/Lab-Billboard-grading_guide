    - If you see a pipeline without proper formatting (each pipe should be on a new line and indented): -5
    - If you see an object being created and never used again: -5
    (That is, somthing like:
        a <- mean(1:10)
        a
    and then "a" is never again referenced.)
    - If they printed out extra content besides that which answers the questions: -5
