Questions to Ponder During Class Demo

How many students have filled out the survey so far?


What possible issues do you see with the way your survey data was stored in the dataset `survey_orig`?


Why do you think we might have made a new dataset, `free_response`?


Explain in words what is different about the dataset `survey` as compared to `survey_orig`.


What did you learn about majors and minors of 331 students?


Look at `survey_courses_1` and `survey_courses_2`.  Explain the difference between these. Why might we want two different formats for the same data?


What did you learn about coursework and majors?


What did you observe about the opinions of Cal Poly students over their course of study?


What other fun things did you find in this data?
