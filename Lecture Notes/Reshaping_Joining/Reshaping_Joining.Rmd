# Setup

Find your R Markdown file in which you explored the `cereals` data.

(This was probably called `Practice.Rmd`.)

# Reshaping

* Note that the `cereals` dataset has separate columns for each nutritional item (`calories`, `sugar`, etc.)

* What if we want to make a plot comparing some of these measures?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(cereals, aes(x = ...????))

```

# Pivoting longer

What if we want to make boxplots comparing the different iris parts?


```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Flower.Part, y = Size)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

# Pivoting longer

What if we want to make boxplots comparing the different iris parts?


```{r}
head(iris)
```

# Pivoting longer

```{r}

iris %>%
  pivot_longer(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width, 
               names_to = "Flower.Part", 
               values_to = "Size")

               values_to = "Size") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Flower.Part, y = Size)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Alert:
## `pivot_longer()` is a new function name!
## It used to be called `gather()`
## `gather()` will still work, but I suggest you run `update.packages("tidyr")`

# Try it!

Create a new dataset called `cereals_3`, that has three columns:
* The name of the cereal
* A column called "Nutrient" with values `protein`, `fat`, or `fiber`.
* A column called "Amount" with the corresponding amount of the nutrient.

# Pivoting wider

What about the reverse reshaping?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
iris %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Sepal.Width)

```
---
# Pivoting wider

Need IDs to pivot wide!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
iris %>%
  mutate(Flower.ID = 1:150) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Sepal.Width,
              id_cols = Flower.ID)

```

# Try it!

Cereals in this dataset are placed on shelf 1, 2, or 3.  We would like to know if these cereal placements correspond to different nutritional values.

Create a new dataset called `cereals_4`, that has four columns:
* The name of the manufacturer
* The mean amount of sugar in cereals on shelf 1.
* The mean amount of sugar in cereals on shelf 2.
* The mean amount of sugar in cereals on shelf 3.

*Hint: You will need to `group_by` and `summarize` first!`

Consider the following three datasets:

```{r}
data1 <- data.frame(
  professor = c("Bodwin", "Glanz", "Carlton", "Sun"),
  undergrad_school = c("Harvard", "Cal Poly", "Cal Poly", "Harvard"),
  grad_school = c("UNC", "Boston University", "UCLA", "Stanford")
)

data2 <- data.frame(
  professor = c("Bodwin", "Glanz", "Carlton"),
  Stat_331 = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),
  Stat_330 = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE),
  Stat_431 = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
)

data3 <- data.frame(
  course = c("Stat_331", "Stat_330", "Stat_431"),
  num_sections = c(8, 3, 1)
)

```

# Joining

```{r}
data1

data2

data3
```

# Joining

Combine datasets 1 and 2 to make this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data1 %>% full_join(data2)


```

---
# Joining

Combine datasets 1 and 2 to make this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data1 %>% right_join(data2)


```
---
# Joining

Combine datasets 2 and 3 to make this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data2 %>%
  pivot_longer(Stat_331:Stat_431, 
               names_to = "course",
               values_to = "can_teach") %>%

We would like to assign teachers for next year, with the following guidelines:

1. Each professor should be given 4 sections.

2. At least half of all 331 sections should be taught by Cal Poly graduates.

3. More than half of all 330 sections should be taught by UCLA graduates.

4. Each professor should teach at least 2 different classes.

**PA 4: How many sections of Stat 331 will Dr. Glanz teach?**
