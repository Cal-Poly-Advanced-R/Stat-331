class: center, middle

# Welcome to Stat 331!

(crashers, please leave the computer seats for enrolled students)

---

# Why you are here

* You are a Stat major?

* You are a Stat minor or a Data Science minor?

* You want to use **R** in your research?

* You think **R** will be useful for your job?

--

**Everyone is welcome - and everyone will have different strengths and weaknesses.**

--

**Make some friends!**

(exchange emails/phonenumber/instachat/snapgram/whatever the kids use)

# What to expect

---

class: center, middle, invert

# Unit 1: R for Data Science

### Weeks 1-3

* basics of R programming

* visualization

* exploratory analysis

* making things pretty in RStudio

---

class: center, middle, invert

# Week 4: A weird one

In week 4, I will be at the annual RStudio Conference in San Francisco.

In lieu of class, you will be asked to do several things:

* Attend a special Watch Party for the conference on **Jan. 29th at 8am.**, if you can.

* Watch at least two of the RStudio Conference talks online.

* Complete several small assignments that will help you learn to teach yourself code from online resources.

* Complete **Project I**, a group data exploration project.

* working with complicated data types

* writing and documenting your own functions

* iteration and functional programming

---
class: center, middle

# Midterm Exam

## Weds, Feb 19

(In-class)

(Open-note, open-internet.)

(Use your own computer if you want.)

---
class: center, middle, invert

# Unit 3: Statistical Computing

In the third unit, we will learn to:

* Implement statistical models

* Simulate data from probability distributions

* Create bootstrap confidence intervals

* Estimate parameters via Monte Carlo methods.
--

Non-majors:  This may be the unit you find difficult!  Let me know if you would like extra stat resources at this stage.

---
class: center, middle

# Final Exam

## (See registar's calendar)

Non-cumulative:  you will be asked to perform statistical computing tasks.

---
class: center, middle

# Project

## Alone, or in group of your choice

You will create a *vignette* and a *Shiny app* to introduce us to a new R package.

More on this later. :)

# Flex Points

**Flex Points** are extra tasks and challenges to enhance your learning.

See the list at: https://rstudio.csm.calpoly.edu/Stat_331-Flex_Points/

--

** FLEX POINTS ARE NOT EXTRA CREDIT!!! **

--

Advice from Stat 150:  Start early!

---
# Practice Activities

* Assigned (almost) every class.

* Due by the next class.

* Meant to be done with help - you may encounter things you haven't learned!

* Submit answers on Canvas.  Infinite tries - you should get 100%!

--

* I suggest you try them *before* class, when possible.

* You will have in-class time to work on them.

* Work together!

---
# Lab Assignments

* Due **Friday at midnight** each week.

* (except Project and Exam weeks)

* "Ordinary" homework tasks involving data analysis

* Working together is fine, but **do not** copy paste code or answers!!!

--

* Turned in by **Sunday at midnight** = -10%

* Turned in after that = not graded, given 50%.

---
# Attendance

![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/xT77Y8eeEhBA8NQwLK/giphy.gif)

I don't take formal attendance.

--

However, I expect you to remain in class and working as long as you still have work left to complete.

(I don't want to answer questions outside of class that could have been addressed in-class.)

---
# Diversity and Inclusion

* I take it very seriously.

--

* Please let me know if I can be better!

* In particular, if you have a disability, I will gladly work with you to make this class accessible.

--

* Register with the **Disability Resource Center** *(Building 124, Room 119
or at 805-756-1395)* for extra accomodations.

* Probably easiest to take exams here - talk to me about this.

---
# Cheating and Plagiarism

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/e133xiIgUYd0I/giphy.gif)

---
# Cheating and Plagiarism

* Never, ever copy-paste someone else's code and turn it in.

* (It is okay to copy-paste your own!)

* (It is okay to copy-paste and then edit.)

* (It is okay to copy-paste when you are practicing.)

--

* Cheating will earn you a grade of 0 on the assignment and an overall grade penalty of at least 10%.

--

* And I will be very upset. :(
