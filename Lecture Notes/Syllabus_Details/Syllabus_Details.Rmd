# Flex Points

**Flex Points** are extra tasks and challenges to enhance your learning.

See the list at: https://rstudio.csm.calpoly.edu/Stat_331-Flex_Points/

--

** FLEX POINTS ARE NOT EXTRA CREDIT!!! **

--

Advice from Stat 150:  Start early!

---
# Practice Activities

* Assigned (almost) every class.

* Due by the next class.

* Meant to be done with help - you may encounter things you haven't learned!

* Submit answers on Canvas.  Infinite tries - you should get 100%!

--

* I suggest you try them *before* class, when possible.

* You will have in-class time to work on them.

* Work together!

---
# Lab Assignments

* Due **Friday at midnight** each week.

* (except Project and Exam weeks)

* "Ordinary" homework tasks involving data analysis

* Working together is fine, but **do not** copy paste code or answers!!!

--

* Turned in by **Sunday at midnight** = -10%

* Turned in after that = not graded, given 50%.

---
# Attendance

![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/xT77Y8eeEhBA8NQwLK/giphy.gif)

I don't take formal attendance.

--

However, I expect you to remain in class and working as long as you still have work left to complete.

(I don't want to answer questions outside of class that could have been addressed in-class.)

---
# Diversity and Inclusion

* I take it very seriously.

--

* Please let me know if I can be better!

* In particular, if you have a disability, I will gladly work with you to make this class accessible.

--

* Register with the **Disability Resource Center** *(Building 124, Room 119
or at 805-756-1395)* for extra accomodations.

* Probably easiest to take exams here - talk to me about this.

# Cheating and Plagiarism

# Cheating and Plagiarism

* Never, ever copy-paste someone else's code and turn it in.

* (It is okay to copy-paste your own!)

* (It is okay to copy-paste and then edit.)

* (It is okay to copy-paste when you are practicing.)

--

* Cheating will earn you a grade of 0 on the assignment and an overall grade penalty of at least 10%.

--

* And I will be very upset. :(
