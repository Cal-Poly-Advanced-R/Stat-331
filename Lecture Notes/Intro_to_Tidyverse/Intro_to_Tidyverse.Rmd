# R History lesson:
# What is the `tidyverse`?

---
# The tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages that follow a (somewhat) consistent philosophy and structure.

The term `base R` is sometimes used as an alternative, to refer to only R's built-in packages.

A brief history:

--

**2008:** `plyr` and `ggplot` released as part of **Hadley Wickham**'s doctoral dissertation.

--

**2012:** The pipe (`%>%`) is created.  

*(While the pipe itself is not technically tidyverse, the tidyverse is built around its use.)*

--

**2014:** `dplyr` released; Wickham hired as Chief Scientist at **RStudio**

--

**Today:** A paid team of 12-ish developers maintains a huge number of packages.  (https://www.tidyverse.org/)

---
# The tidyverse

**Pros:**

* Some consider it more accessible/readable

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

iris[iris$Species == "setosa",]
```

*Pipe-friendly*

*English verbs instead of symbols*


---
# The tidyverse

**Pros:**

* Fairly consistent behavior of functions

    + Predictable **input** and **output** types
    + More on this later
    
--

* Semi-guaranteed maintenance (because RStudio pays devs)

--

* More available documentation and tutorials

--

* Welcoming community

---
# The tidyverse

**Cons:**

* Sometimes less flexible for complex tasks

--

* Generally slower, especially on big data

(see:  `data.table`)
(see:  `dtplyr`)

--

* Updates frequently -> sometimes this makes your old code unrunnable.

--

* Some people object to **RStudio**'s strong influence over an open-source community.

# Should you use the tidyverse???

--

Even the most die-hard `tidyverse` fantatics (see: Dr.B.) use base R and other packages for some tasks!

--

Above all, the best code approach is the one you enjoy the most and that gets the job done!

--

You are free to use whatever package(s) you want in this class!

# Prerequisite:  The Pipe  `%>%`

---

# The Pipe

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair_code('iris %>% summary()', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  hlt_fixed("%>%") %>% 
  hlt_funs(color = "teal")
```

is the same as

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair_code('summary(iris)', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  hlt_funs(color = "teal")
```


* Originally part of the `magrittr` package

* Central to the philosophy and design of the *tidyverse*
---
## Idea 1: Analysis steps should flow sequentially.
## Idea 2: Code should read a bit like an English sentence.

What do you think the following will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  filter(hp > 100) %>%
  arrange(mpg)
```

(demo)
---
# Today's Data: Cereal

* Download `Practice.Rmd` from Canvas.

* Run the first two chunks to load up the `cereal` dataset.

* Get a feel for the data - what does it contain?


---

# Summarizing

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair_code('
iris %>%
  summary()
  ') %>% hlt_fixed("y(")
```

---
# Summarizing

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair_code('
iris %>%
  summarize(mean(Petal.Length))
  ') %>% 
  hlt_fixed("ize(") %>% 
  hlt_fixed("mean", color = "teal") %>%
  hlt_fixed("Petal.Length", color = "cornflowerblue")
```

--

* What are the **required** arguments of `summarize`?  

* Are there any optional arguments?

---

# Many variables?  Many summary statistics?
## No problemo

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair_code('
iris %>%
  summarize_at(vars(Petal.Length, Petal.Width),
            funs(mean, median))
  ') %>% 
  hlt_fixed("_at") %>%
  hlt_regexp("(mean)|(median)", color = "teal") %>%
  hlt_regexp("(Petal.Length)|(Petal.Width)", color = "cornflowerblue") %>%
  hlt_regexp("(vars)|(funs)", color = "darkred")
```

class: center, middle, invert
# In `Practice.Rmd`, find the following:

* Mean, Median, and standard deviaton of the sugar content of cereals

* Total calories of all cereals together

---
# Making new variables

Verb: `mutate()`

The dataset gets *mutated* to include a new variable.

```{r}
iris %>%
  mutate(
    Petal.Size = Petal.Length*Petal.Width
  ) %>%
  str()
```

---

Cool, let's look at our new variable!

```{r, error = TRUE}
iris %>%
  summarize_at(vars(Petal.Size), funs(mean, median))
```

OH NO!

**What happened here?**

---

class: center, middle

# We calculated a new variable, but didn't save our changes.

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair_code('
iris_new <- iris %>%
          mutate(
            Petal.Size = Petal.Length*Petal.Width
          )
          
iris_new$Petal.Size
') %>% hlt_fixed("iris_new <- ")


```

---
# Ordering

Verb: `arrange()`

We **arrange** the dataset in order of a particular variable.

```{r}
iris_new %>% 
  arrange(Petal.Width)
```

---

## Related: `top_n`

```{r}
iris_new %>%
  top_n(3, Petal.Width)
```

---

# Quick check in!

Remember,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris_new %>%
  top_n(3, Petal.Width)
```

is the same as

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(iris_new, 3, Petal.Width)
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(x = iris_new, n = 3, wt = Petal.Width)
```

---

# Selecting

Verb: `select()`

We **select** which variables we would like to remain in the dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris_new %>%
  select(Species, Petal.Size) %>%
  arrange(Petal.Size)
```

---

# Filtering

Verb: `filter()`

We **filter** which variables we would like to remain in the dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris_new %>%
  select(Species, Petal.Size) %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
  arrange(Petal.Size)
```

---
class: center, middle, invert

# Your Turn!

---

## In `Practice.Rmd`, make a new dataset called `kellogg_calories`, with the following changes:

1. There is a new variable called `cal_per_serving` which shows the number of calories in each serving of the cereals.

2. The dataset only includes this new variable, the name of the cereal, and the brand of the cereal.

3. The dataset only includes Kellogg brand cereals

4. The cereals in the dataset are ordered from most to least calories.

**For bonus points, do all these in one sequence of pipes!**


---

# Plotting: The pipe is your friend

Want a histogram of just *setosa* iris sepal lengths?  Pipe it through `filter()` first!

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
iris %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

# YOUR TURN

---
class: center, middle

## For each of the four main plot types (histogram, barplot, boxplot, scatterplot), make an interesting visualization from your cereal dataset.

---
class:center,middle,invert

# Grouping and summarizing
---
# `group_by`

* We just learned how to use the `summarize` functions to get information.

* What if you want to summarize your data within categories?

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(mean(Sepal.Length))

```
---
# Try it!

* Find the average calories per cereal for each manufacturer.

* Find the average sugar per cereal for hot and cold cereals.
