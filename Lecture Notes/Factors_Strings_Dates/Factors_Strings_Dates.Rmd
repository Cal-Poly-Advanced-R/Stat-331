# Setup

Find your R Markdown file where you cleaned the dataset `colleges.csv` and rerun your code to create `colleges_clean`.

Alternatively, start a new R Markdown file, and load in the dataset `colleges_clean.csv`, which is posted on Canvas.

# Factors

# Factors

Common tasks:

* Turn a `character` or `numeric` into a factor

* Make a factor by "binning" a numeric variable

* Rename or reorder the `levels` of a factor


The packages `forcats`  ("for categoricals") gives nice shortcuts for manipulating categorical variables.


(`forcats` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---
# Turn to factor

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "dog", "banana", "cat", "banana", "Queen Elizabeth", "dog")

x

x <- factor(x)

x

```


---
# Recoding

```{r}
x <- fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana", pet = "dog", pet ="cat")

x
```

---
# `case_when()`

A catchall shortcut for making categorical variables is `case_when`.

```{r}
iris %>%
  mutate(
    Flower.Size = case_when(
      Sepal.Length < 5 ~ "Small",
      Sepal.Length > 6 ~ "Large",
      TRUE ~ "Medium"
    )
  ) %>%
    select(Sepal.Length, Flower.Size)
```

---
# Try the following.  What did it do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

colleges_clean <- 
  colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    CONTROL = factor(CONTROL),
    Type = fct_recode(CONTROL, Public = "1", Private = "2")
  )
  

```

---
# Forcats

We will not practice every single function in the `forcats` package.

Find the `forcats` "cheatsheet" at https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-developed/factors

Use it to answer the following (in the Google doc!):

* What is the difference between `fct_relevel()` and `fct_recode()`?

* What is the difference between `fct_collapse()` and `fct_lump()`?

* What is the difference between `fct_reorder()` and `fct_inorder()`?

*Hint: Make up a couple of factors, and see what happens when you use these functions on them.*

# Strings

<img src="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/logo.png" width=300>

---

# Strings

A **string** is a bunch of **characters**.

Don't confuse a **string** (many characters, one object) with a **character vector** (vector of strings)


```{r}
my_string <- "Hi, my name is Kelly!"

my_vector <- c("Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Kelly")

my_string

my_vector
```

---
# Strings

Common tasks:

* Find which strings contain a particular pattern

* Remove or replace a pattern

* Edit a string (for example, make it lowercase)


The packages `stringr` is very useful for strings!

(`stringr` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---

# Find patterns

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hi there", "my name is", "Kelly Bodwin")

str_detect(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_locate(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_extract(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_subset(my_vector, "Kelly")
```

---

# Replace/Remove patterns


```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hi there", "my name is", "Kelly Bodwin")

str_remove(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_replace(my_vector, "Kelly", replacement = "George")
```

---

# Make edits

```{r}
my_string <- "Hi, my name is Kelly!"

str_to_lower(my_string)
str_to_upper(my_string)
```

---
# Your Turn

Using your `colleges_clean` dataset... 

* How exactly does Cal Poly's name appear in this dataset?

* **(hard!)** How many colleges have the word "University" in their name?

* **(harder!)** What is Harvard's out of state tuition?


Hint:  Remember that the `str_*` functions need the first argument to be a **vector of strings**, not a **dataset**.  You might want to use them *inside* functions like `filter` or `mutate`


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean$INSTNM %>%
  str_subset("Polytechnic")
```


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_univ = str_detect(INSTNM, "University")
  ) %>%
  count(is_univ)
```



```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_harv = str_detect(INSTNM, "Harvard")
  ) %>%
  filter(is_harv) %>%
  select(TUITIONFEE_OUT)
```

# Dates

---

# Dates

Common tasks:

* Convert a date-like variable ("April 2, 1989") to a special DateTime Object.

* Find the weekday, month, year, etc from a DateTime object

* Convert between timezones

--

The package `lubridate` is **AMAZING** for this. 

If you work with dates often, please explore the functions - we are happy to help you after the workshop!


(`lubridate` does **NOT** load with the `tidyverse`)

---
# lubridate

Reference the `lubridate` cheatsheet: https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_lubridate.pdf

Answer the following using code (even if you know the answer already).

1. Save your birthday as a Datetime object in R.  

```{r, include = FALSE}
bday <- make_date(year = 1989, month = 04, day = 02)
```


2. What day of the week does/did your birthday fall on in 2020?

```{r, include = FALSE}
bday2 <- bday
year(bday2) <- 2020
bday2 %>% wday(label = TRUE)
```

3. On what day of the week should you plan your 100th birthday party?

```{r, include = FALSE}
(bday + years(100)) %>% wday(label = TRUE)
```

4. Find the date that is exactly 9 months before your birthday.  If it falls on a holiday, think about the implications.

```{r, include = FALSE}
bday - months(9)
```

---
# Zodiac

The dataset `zodiac.csv ` on Canvas gives the date ranges for the 12 Zodiac signs.  By making appropriate adjustments and calculations, find your Zodiac sign.

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
zodiac <- read.csv("../Data/zodiac.csv")

zodiac %>% separate(Dates, into = c("Start", "End"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(
    Start = parse_date_time(Start, order = "md"),
    End = parse_date_time(End, order = "md")
  ) %>%
  filter(bday2 >= Start, bday2 <= End)

```
