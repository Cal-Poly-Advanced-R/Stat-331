# Reasons to be fluent in Base R

1. The `tidyverse` doesn't replace *everything* in R.

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
2 + 2

2 %>% plus(2)

```

--

The `tidyverse` is designed to make **Data Science** easier, not necessarily all computing tasks.

2. If you build your own tools, you will probably build them in Base.
    + Fewer *dependencies*
    + More "under the hood" programming.
    + It's generally a bit faster.

3. You will probably see it in other people's code.
    + You want to be able to work with them.

# A few Basics of Base

---
# Subsetting

**Tidy:** "Slice the dataset down to the second row."
```{r}
iris %>%
  slice(2)
```

---
# Subsetting

**Base:** "Give me the 2nd row, and all the columns."

```{r}
iris[2,]
```


---
# Conditional Subsetting

**Tidy:** "Filter by this condition."
```{r}
iris %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa")
```

---
# Conditional Subsetting

**Base:** "Find the rows where the condition is true; then "
```{r subset}
is_setosa <- iris$Species == "setosa"

iris[is_setosa, ]
```

---
# Conditional Subsetting

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("subset") %>% flair(", ]") %>% flair("iris$")
```

---
# Conditional Subsetting

Once you get used to this approach...

```{r subset2, include = FALSE}
iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("subset2") %>% flair('iris$Species == "setosa"')
```

---

# The subset function

A very handy shortcut to base subsetting:

```{r}
subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
```

```{r}

# Selecting columns

What type of object does this output?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris %>%
  select(Petal.Length)
```

--

How about this?


```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris[, "Petal.Length"]
```

---
# Selecting columns

If you want a **vector**:

```{r pull, include = FALSE}
iris %>%
  pull(Petal.Length)

iris[, "Petal.Length"]

iris[["Petal.Length"]]
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("pull", eval = FALSE) %>% flair("pull") %>% flair("[[") %>% flair("]]")
```


--

If you want a **data frame** with **one column**:


```{r drop, include = FALSE}
iris %>%
  select(Petal.Length)

subset(iris, select = Petal.Length)

iris[, "Petal.Length", drop = FALSE]
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("drop", eval = FALSE) %>% flair(", drop = FALSE")
```

# Conditional altering

Suppose I have suddenly realized that I misrecorded the `setosa` iris data.  Oh no!

Every petal width of a setosa iris is listed as 1cm shorter than it should be.

How would you fix this in the tidyverse?

---
# Conditional altering

**Tidy:** `mutate` + `case_when`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris %>%
  mutate(
    Petal.Width = case_when(
      Species == "setosa" ~ Petal.Width + 1,
      TRUE ~ Petal.Width
    )
  )
```

... is there a better solution?  This is a lot of typing for a quick fix.

---
# Conditional altering

**Base:** Replace only certain rows using `<-`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is_setosa <- iris$Species == "setosa"

iris[is_setosa, "Petal.Width"] <- iris[is_setosa, "Petal.Width"] + 1
```

--
A bit repetitive, but maybe nicer?
--

But, **dangerous!**

---
# Conditional altering

What will go wrong in each of the following?

1. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is_setosa <- Species == "setosa"

iris[is_setosa, "Petal.Width"] <- iris[is_setosa, "Petal.Width"] + 1
```

2. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is_setosa <- iris$Species == "setosa"

iris[is_setosa, ] <- iris[is_setosa, "Petal.Width"] + 1
```

3.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is_setosa <- iris$Species == "setosa"

iris$Petal.Width <- iris[is_setosa, "Petal.Width"] + 1
```

# Grouping and Summarizing

**Tidy:** `group_by`, `summarize`

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(mean(Petal.Length))
```

---
# Grouping and Summarizing

**Base:** ... yikes.

```{r}
mean(iris[iris$Species == "setosa", "Petal.Width"])
mean(iris[iris$Species == "virginica", "Petal.Width"])
mean(iris[iris$Species == "versicolor", "Petal.Width"])
```

---
# Grouping and Summarizing

**Slightly Better Base:** limited, but clean

```{r agg, include = FALSE}
aggregate(Petal.Width ~ Species, mean, data = iris)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("agg") %>% flair("Petal.Width ~ Species")
```

# Reasons to use `data.table`

Maybe you prefer the syntax?

**SPEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

![](needforspeed.gif)

--

`data.table` will essentially **always** be the fastest option.

For all the data we use in this class, the difference is negligible.

But one day, you might have massive data that is slow in `dplyr`.

---

![](losdos.jpg)

`dtplyr` is a very new package that wraps `data.table` in `dplyr`.

`tidydt` does the same, but possibly more extensive?

Disclaimer:  These are brand new; I don't know much about them.  

(For my data, `dplyr` is plenty fast.)
