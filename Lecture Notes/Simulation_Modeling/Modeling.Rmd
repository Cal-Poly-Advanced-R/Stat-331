# Sampling from data

## Our best friend the titanic dataset

```{r}
head(titanic)
```

## Sampling from data

Let's take a sample of 10 passengers:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sample

```

# Probability distributions

## Probability distributions

Recall from your previous statistics classes...

- A **random variable** is a value we don't know until we take a **sample**.
    + Coin flip:  Could be heads (0) or tails (1)
    + Person's height:  Could be anything from 0 feet to 20 feet.
- The possible values of a random variable, and how likely they are, is determined by the **distribution**.
    + Coin flip has 50% chance of heads, 50% chance of tails
    + Likelihood of heights follow a bell curve around 5 foot 7.
    
## Probability distributions

- Some distributions have names.  For this class, you need to know:
    + Uniform
    + Normal
    + t-distribution
    + Binomial
    + Chi-Square
- (What you need to know: basic idea of when it is appropriate to use them.)
    
## Distributions in R

- r for **random sampling**: generate a random value from the
distribution

```{r}
runif(3)
runif(3, min = 10, max = 20)

rnorm(3)
rnorm(3, mean = -100, sd = 50)


```

## Distributions in R

- r for **random sampling**: generate a random value from the
distribution

```{r}

rt(3, df = 11)

rbinom(3, size = 10, prob = 0.7)

rchisq(3, df = 11)
```

## Distributions in R

- p for **probability**: cumulative distribution function, i.e.
compute P(X < x)

```{r}
pnorm(1.5)
pnorm(70, mean = 67, sd = 3)

1 - pnorm(70, mean = 67, sd = 3)
```

## Exercise

- What is the probability that a Chi-Square distribution with 35 degrees of freedom gives a value of 25 or less?
- What is the probability that 10 coin tosses give 6 or more heads?

## Distributions in R

- q for **quantile**: given a probability p, compute the x-value
such that P(X < x) = p.

```{r}
qnorm(.95)
qnorm(.95, mean = 67, sd = 3)
```

## Exercise

- If I randomly sample a number between 16 and 22, I can be 80% sure my number will be less than what?
- What is the critical value for a 1-sided t-test at the 0.05 significance level, with a sample size of 50?


## Distributions in R

- d for **density**: compute the height of the mass or density
curve/function
    + Continuous distributions: usually meaningless

## Exercise

- What is the probability of getting exactly 12 heads in 20 coin tosses?

# Let's practice!

## Let's practice!
- WITHOUT USING R, try to predict the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

punif(0.674)

pnorm(2)
qnorm(.975)

pchisq(0, df = 12)

qt(10, df = 16)

dbinom(1, size = 2, prob = .87)
pbinom(1, size = 2, prob = .87)

```

## Let's practice!


```{r, eval = TRUE}

punif(0.674)

pnorm(2)
qnorm(.975)

```

## Let's practice!


```{r, eval = TRUE}
pchisq(0, df = 12)

qt(10, df = 16)

dbinom(1, size = 2, prob = .87)
pbinom(1, size = 2, prob = .87)

```

## Plotting distributions

```{r}
my_samples <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100))

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + geom_histogram()
```

## Plotting distributions

```{r}
ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) 
```

## Plotting distributions

```{r}

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, aes(y = ..density..))
```

## Plotting distributions

```{r}

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, aes(y = ..density..)) + 
  stat_function(fun=dnorm, col = "red")
```


# Basic hypothesis tests in R

# Interlude: Review on t-tests and chi-square tests.

## t-tests

We would like to test if men or women paid more on the Titanic.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?t.test
```

## t-tests

We would like to test if men or women paid more on the Titanic.

```{r}
t.test(Fare ~ Sex, data = titanic)
```

## Tidying it up

That output is not tidy!

```{r}
my_test <- t.test(Fare ~ Sex, data = titanic)
tidy(my_test)  ## requires the 'broom' package!
```

## Tidying it up

Why is tidying nice?  For easily referencing the info later.

```{r}
my_test <- tidy(t.test(Fare ~ Sex, data = titanic))
my_test$p.value
1 - pt(my_test$statistic, df = nrow(titanic))
```

## Chisquared Tests

What input is expected?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?chisq.test
```

## Chisquared Tests
```{r}
titanic %>% count(Sex, Pclass)
```

## Chisquared Tests

```{r}
titanic %>% 
  count(Sex, Pclass) %>%
  spread(key = Sex, value = n)
```

## Chisquared Tests

```{r}
titanic %>% 
  count(Sex, Pclass) %>%
  spread(key = Sex, value = n) %>%
  select(female, male)
```

## Chisquared Tests

```{r}
titanic %>% 
  count(Sex, Pclass) %>%
  spread(key = Sex, value = n) %>%
  select(female, male) %>%
  chisq.test()
```

## Chisquared Tests

```{r}
titanic %>% 
  count(Sex, Pclass) %>%
  spread(key = Sex, value = n) %>%
  select(female, male) %>%
  chisq.test() %>%
  tidy()
```


# Many models

## List-columns

A dataset.... with a variable... of datasets?

```{r}

titanic %>% group_by(Pclass) %>% nest()

```


## Yo dawg, I heard you like datasets...

![dawg](../Images/Yo-Dawg.jpg)

## Multiple tests

```{r}

t_by_class <- titanic %>% 
  group_by(Pclass) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  arrange(Pclass)

my_tests <- map_df(t_by_class$data, 
                   ~tidy(t.test(Fare ~ Sex, data = .x)))

my_tests
```



# Linear models.... later!
