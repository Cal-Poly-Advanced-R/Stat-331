# Iteration

- What if you want to do something a whole bunch of times, or to every item in a list?  


```r
print("99 bottles of pop on the wall, 
      99 bottles of pop.  
      Take one down, pass it around, 
      98 bottles of pop on the wall.")
```

```
## [1] "99 bottles of pop on the wall, \n      99 bottles of pop.  \n      Take one down, pass it around, \n      98 bottles of pop on the wall."
```

```r
print("98 bottles of pop on the wall, 
      98 bottles of pop.  
      Take one down, pass it around, 
      97 bottles of pop on the wall.")
```

```
## [1] "98 bottles of pop on the wall, \n      98 bottles of pop.  \n      Take one down, pass it around, \n      97 bottles of pop on the wall."
```

```r
###.... and so on...
```

# We could write a function...


```r
sing_about_pop &lt;- function(num) {
  
  
  paste(num,
    "bottles of pop on the wall,",
    num,
    "bottles of pop.",
    "Take one down, pass it around,",
    num - 1,
    "bottles of pop on the wall.")
  
}
```

---
# We could write a function...


```r
library(glue)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'glue'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
## 
##     collapse
```

```r
sing_about_pop &lt;- function(num) {
  
  
  glue("{num} bottles of pop on the wall, {num} bottles of pop.
       Take one down, pass it around, {num - 1} bottles of pop on the wall.")
  
}
```

---
# This helped!

... but it is still repetitive...


```r
sing_about_pop(99)
```

```
## 99 bottles of pop on the wall, 99 bottles of pop.
## Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of pop on the wall.
```

```r
sing_about_pop(98)
```

```
## 98 bottles of pop on the wall, 98 bottles of pop.
## Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of pop on the wall.
```

```r
sing_about_pop(97)
```

```
## 97 bottles of pop on the wall, 97 bottles of pop.
## Take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of pop on the wall.
```

---
# Good: For loops


```r
for (i in 99:95) {
  
  sing_about_pop(i)

}
```
--

... wait, where did it go?

---
# Print!


```r
for (i in 99:95) {
  
  print(sing_about_pop(i))

}
```

```
## 99 bottles of pop on the wall, 99 bottles of pop.
## Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of pop on the wall.
## 98 bottles of pop on the wall, 98 bottles of pop.
## Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of pop on the wall.
## 97 bottles of pop on the wall, 97 bottles of pop.
## Take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of pop on the wall.
## 96 bottles of pop on the wall, 96 bottles of pop.

# Good: For loops

**Pro:**

* Classic programming approach; easy to understand

* Can change values at each loop step.


**Con:**

* Slow in R.

* A little messy to read the code

* Not always necessary.

# Better: The `apply` functions


```r
sapply(99:95, sing_about_pop)
```

```
## [1] "99 bottles of pop on the wall, 99 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [2] "98 bottles of pop on the wall, 98 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [3] "97 bottles of pop on the wall, 97 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [4] "96 bottles of pop on the wall, 96 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 95 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [5] "95 bottles of pop on the wall, 95 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 94 bottles of pop on the wall."
```
---
# Better: The `apply` functions

- Pay attention to what type of input they *take* and what type of output they *give*

- `sapply` takes a vector, returns a vector

- `lapply` takes a list, returns a list

- `apply` takes a dataset and a dimension (1 = row, 2 = col), returns a vector or list

---
# Best:  The `map` functions from `purrr`



```r
map_chr(99:95, sing_about_pop)
```

```
## [1] "99 bottles of pop on the wall, 99 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [2] "98 bottles of pop on the wall, 98 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [3] "97 bottles of pop on the wall, 97 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [4] "96 bottles of pop on the wall, 96 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 95 bottles of pop on the wall."
## [5] "95 bottles of pop on the wall, 95 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 94 bottles of pop on the wall."
```

---
# Best:  The `map` functions from `purrr`

- `map` always returns a **list**

- `map_chr` always returns a **character vector**  (or an error)

- What do you think `map_dbl` returns?

---

# What if I want some options in my function?


```r
sing_about_drinks &lt;- function(num, drink) {
  
  
    
  glue("{num} bottles of {drink} on the wall, {num} bottles of {drink}.
       Take one down, pass it around, {num - 1} bottles of {drink} on the wall.")
  
}
```

---
# `sapply` has trouble!


```r
sapply(99:95, sing_about_drinks(drink = "beer"))
```

```
## Error in eval(parse(text = text, keep.source = FALSE), envir): argument "num" is missing, with no default
```
---

# You can kind of get around this...

(This is called a **headless function**)


```r
sapply(99:95, function(x) sing_about_drinks(x, drink = "beer"))
```

```
## [1] "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [2] "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [3] "97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [4] "96 bottles of beer on the wall, 96 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 95 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [5] "95 bottles of beer on the wall, 95 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 94 bottles of beer on the wall."
```

---

# But `map` has a cool shortcut!

- Note the "~" in front of the function - this is important!

- Note the "." before the "x" - this is important!


```r
map_chr(99:95, ~sing_about_drinks(.x, "beer"))
```

```
## [1] "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [2] "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [3] "97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [4] "96 bottles of beer on the wall, 96 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 95 bottles of beer on the wall."
## [5] "95 bottles of beer on the wall, 95 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 94 bottles of beer on the wall."
```

# What if I want to use many options?




```r
head(data)
```

```
##   num    drink
## 1  99      pop
## 2  98     beer
## 3  97    water
## 4  96 lemonade
## 5  95     milk
```

---
# Use `map2`!


```r
map2_chr(data$num, data$drink, ~sing_about_drinks(.x, .y))
```

```
## [1] "99 bottles of pop on the wall, 99 bottles of pop.\nTake one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of pop on the wall."               
## [2] "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.\nTake one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall."            
## [3] "97 bottles of water on the wall, 97 bottles of water.\nTake one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of water on the wall."         
## [4] "96 bottles of lemonade on the wall, 96 bottles of lemonade.\nTake one down, pass it around, 95 bottles of lemonade on the wall."
## [5] "95 bottles of milk on the wall, 95 bottles of milk.\nTake one down, pass it around, 94 bottles of milk on the wall."

# The very best: Vectorized functions

## What does it mean to be vectorized?


```r
add_odds &lt;- function(x,y){
  
  if(x %%2 == 1 &amp; y %% 2 == 1){
    
    x + y
    
  } else {
    
   0
    
  }
  
}
```

---

# What does it mean to be vectorized?


```r
add_odds(1,3)
```

```
## [1] 4
```

```r
add_odds(2,4)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

---

# What does it mean to be vectorized?


```r
first_nums &lt;- c(1,2)
next_nums &lt;- c(3,4)

add_odds(first_nums, next_nums)
```

```
## Warning in if (x%%2 == 1 &amp; y%%2 == 1) {: the condition has length &gt; 1 and only
## the first element will be used
```

```
## [1] 4 6
```

---

# What does it mean to be vectorized?

`add_odds` is not a vectorized function!


```r
add_odds &lt;- function(x,y){
  
  if(x %%2 == 1 &amp; y %% 2 == 1){
    
    x + y
    
  } else {
    
   0
    
  }
  
}
```

---

# We can try to make it vectorized...
 

```r
add_odds_2 &lt;- function(x,y){
  
  is_odd &lt;- x %% 2 == 1 &amp; y %% 2 == 1
  
  answers &lt;- rep(0, length(x))
  
  answers &lt;- x + y
  
  answers[!is_odd] &lt;- 0
  
}
```

---
# We can try to make it vectorized...


```r
first_nums &lt;- c(1,2)
next_nums &lt;- c(3,4)

add_odds_2(first_nums, next_nums)
```

---
# But, what if we can't vectorize?
## Iteration!


```r
first_nums &lt;- c(1,2)
next_nums &lt;- c(3,4)

map2(first_nums, next_nums, ~add_odds(.x, .y))
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 4
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 0
```

## Things to remember

- What does your function take as INPUT?

- What does your function give as OUTPUT?

- How can we write it to be friendly with `apply` or `map`?

- Do you REALLY need to use `apply` or `map`, or is it vectorized?

- Bonus: How can we write it to be friendly with `%&gt;%`?
