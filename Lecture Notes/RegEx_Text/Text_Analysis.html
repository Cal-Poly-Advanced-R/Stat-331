# Regular Expressions

A **regular expression** is a way of "fuzzy matching" text.


```r
my_str &lt;- c("Kelly", "Jelly", "Belly", "Smelly", "Hi Kelly", "Kelly Bodwin")

str_extract(my_str, "Kelly")
```

```
## [1] "Kelly" NA      NA      NA      "Kelly" "Kelly"
```

--


```r
str_extract(my_str, ".elly")
```

```
## [1] "Kelly" "Jelly" "Belly" "melly" "Kelly" "Kelly"
```

--


```r
str_extract(my_str, "[A-z]+elly")
```

```
## [1] "Kelly"  "Jelly"  "Belly"  "Smelly" "Kelly"  "Kelly"
```

---
# Regular Expressions

* Letters and numbers match themselves

* `.` matches any character at all

* "escape" a special character with `\\` to match the literal character

---
# Regular Expressions

* `^` matches the start of the string


```r
str_subset(my_str, "^Kelly")
```

```
## [1] "Kelly"        "Kelly Bodwin"
```

--

* `$` matches the end of the string


```r
str_subset(my_str, "Kelly$")
```

```
## [1] "Kelly"    "Hi Kelly"
```

---
# Regular Expressions

* `{2}` means "the thing before me, exactly twice.

* `+` means "the thing before me, 1 to infinity times."

* `*` means "the thing before me, 0 to infinity times."




```r
my_str &lt;- c("Key", "Kely", "Kelly", "Kellly", "Kelllllly")
```

--


```r
str_subset(my_str, "l{2}")
```

```
## [1] "Kelly"     "Kellly"    "Kelllllly"
```

--


```r
str_subset(my_str, "l+")
```

```
## [1] "Kely"      "Kelly"     "Kellly"    "Kelllllly"
```

--


```r
str_subset(my_str, "l*")
```

```
## [1] "Key"       "Kely"      "Kelly"     "Kellly"    "Kelllllly"
```

---

# Regular Expressions

* `[:alpha:]` or `[A-z]` matches any letter
* `[:punct:]` matches any punctuation
* (many more of these - see `stringr` cheatsheet!)
* `()` groups things together
* `[]` is "match any of these"

--


```r
my_str &lt;- c("Kelly", "Kelkel")

str_subset(my_str, "([Kk]el){2}")
```

```
## [1] "Kelkel"
```

# Quick quiz

What will the following outputs be?


```r
my_str &lt;- "The Dursleys of Number 4 Privet Drive were 
happy to say that they were perfectly 
normal, thank you very much."

str_extract_all(my_str, ".*")

str_extract_all(my_str, "\\w")

str_extract_all(my_str, "\\s")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:alpha:]+")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:alpha:]*\\.")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[wv]er[ey]")
```
---
# Harder quick quiz

What will the following outputs be?


```r
my_str &lt;- "The Dursleys of Number 4 Privet Drive were 
happy to say that they were perfectly 
normal, thank you very much."

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:digit:] ([A-Z][a-z]*)+")

str_extract_all(my_str, "(?&lt;=[:digit:] )[:alpha:]+")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:digit:].*Drive")

my_str %&gt;%
  str_split() %&gt;%
  str_extract("^[A-Z]")
```

# Your Turn

The file `hamlet.txt` contains the text of the play "Hamlet" by Shakespeare.  Download this file and save it somewhere reasonable.  Read it into R as a string with:


```r
hamlet &lt;- readLines("./hamlet_speech.txt")
```

```
## Warning in readLines("./hamlet_speech.txt"): incomplete final line found on './
## hamlet_speech.txt'
```

---
# Your Turn

Answer the following:

* How many words are in the speech?  (Hint: `str_count`)
* How many times does Hamlet reference death or dying?
* How many sentences are in the speech?
* What is the longest word in the speech?
* What is the only capitalized word that does not start a sentence or line?

*Hint:* You may want to use `str_c()` for some of these, to make the vector into a single string.

# Tokenizing

&lt;img src="tidytext.png" width=300&gt;

# Converting text to data

We need to separate text into words and/or n-grams.  These are called **tokens**.

The package `tokenizers` makes this much easier.


```r
library(tokenizers)

hamlet %&gt;%
  str_c(collapse = " ") %&gt;%
  tokenize_words()
```

# Sentiment analysis

A popular approach to text analysis to to analyze *sentiments*, or how positive/negative certain language is.


```r
library(tidytext)

positive &lt;- get_sentiments("bing") %&gt;%
  filter(sentiment == "positive")

positive
```

```
## # A tibble: 2,005 x 2
##    word        sentiment
##    &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    
##  1 abound      positive 
##  2 abounds     positive 
##  3 abundance   positive 
##  4 abundant    positive 
##  5 accessable  positive 
##  6 accessible  positive 
##  7 acclaim     positive 
##  8 acclaimed   positive 
##  9 acclamation positive 
## 10 accolade    positive

# Sentiment analysis


```r
hdf &lt;- hamlet %&gt;%
  str_c(collapse = " ") %&gt;%
  tokenize_words() %&gt;%
  data.frame()

names(hdf) &lt;- "word"
```

# Sentiment analysis


```r
hdf %&gt;%
  semi_join(positive) %&gt;%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

```
## Joining, by = "word"
```

```
## Warning: Column `word` joining factor and character vector, coercing into

```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    word        n
