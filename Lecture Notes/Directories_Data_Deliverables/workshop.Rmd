# Grouping and summarizing
---
# `group_by`

* Last module, we learned how to use the `summarize` functions to get information.
* What if you want to summarize your data within categories?

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(mean(Sepal.Length))

```

# Try it!

* Find the average calories per cereal for each manufacturer.

* Find the average sugar per cereal for hot and cold cereals.

# Reshaping

* Note that the `cereals` dataset has separate columns for each nutritional item (`calories`, `sugar`, etc.)

* What if we want to make a plot comparing some of these measures?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(cereals, aes(x = ...????))

# Alert:
## `gather()` will be renamed to `pivot_long` in the next `tidyverse` relase
## (Plus lots of other handy pivoting.)
---
# Try it!

Create a new dataset called `cereals_3`, that has three columns:
* The name of the cereal
* A column called "Nutrient" with values `protein`, `fat`, or `fiber`.
* A column called "Amount" with the corresponding amount of the nutrient.

# Spread/pivot_wide

What about the reverse reshaping?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
iris_long <- iris %>%
  mutate(Flower.ID = 1:150) %>%
  gather(key = "Flower.Part", value = "Size", -Species, -Flower.ID)

iris_long
```

# Spread/pivot_wide

```{r}
iris_long %>%
  spread(Flower.Part, Size)
```

# Quick quiz

* Why did I need to add the "Flower.ID" column?

```{r, error = TRUE}
iris_long %>%
  select(-Flower.ID) %>%
  spread(Flower.Part, Size)

# Principles of Reproducibility

The idea:  You should be able to send your project to someone else, and they can jump in and start working right away.

1. Files are organized and well-named.
2. References to data and code work for everyone. (Projects!)
3. Package dependency is clear.  (`library`)
4. Code will run the same every time, even if data values change.
5. Analysis process is well-explained and easy to read.

---
# Bad practice

If you put something like this at the top of your .Rmd file, I will set your computer on fire:

```{r setwd, eval = FALSE}
setwd("/User/kbodwin/Dropbox/Teaching/331/Data/")
```

- Setting working directory by hand = BAD!  
- That directory is specific to you!  Where should someone else look for the data?
- Markdown files won't knit this code.

# Dealing with packages

---

## install.packages()

To use a package, it must first be *installed* to your copy of RStudio.

This only needs to happen **ONCE** per computer or server.

```{r install packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

---

# update.packages()

If a computer you are using has the package, but you aren't sure if it's up to date:

```{r update packages, eval = FALSE}
update.packages("tidyverse")
```

to install the most recent version.

# NEVER EVER EVER EVER PUT "install.packages" or "update.packages" INTO YOUR MARKDOWN FILE!!!!!

---

# library() and require()

- A package must only be *installed* once.
- But it must be *loaded* every time, to tell R it is needed for this particular analysis.
- `library` gives an **error** if the package isn't installed
- `require` gives a `TRUE/FALSE` value depending on if the package was available
- For now, you should always use `library`

```{r library, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# notice:  no quotes around package name
```

# Deliverables in Markdown

# General principles

- Give your file a good title, author, and date
- Name your file something meaningful (match the title!)
- Use `#` to make section headings etc.  (see cheatsheet)
- Each code chunk is a unified thought.
- Text before and after each code chunk to motivate your code and explain the output.
- Make deliberate decisions about what to display:
    + Does the reader need to see data loading step?
    + Does the reader need to see your code?
    + Does the reader need to see the output?

# Naming code chunks

- Lets you jump between chunks - see demo.
- Careful with copy-pasting, duplicate names are not allowed.

---

# Setting chunk options

- `echo`: Should this code be **shown** (echoed)?
- `eval`: Should this code be **run** (evaluated)?
- `include`: Should this code be neither shown nor run?
- `error`: If there is an error, should that display rather than breaking the knit?
- `warning`: If there is a warning, should that display?
- `message`: If there is a message, should that display?

---
## Setting options for ALL chunks

What does this do?

```{r global_options, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=4,
                      echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, 
                      message=FALSE, eval=TRUE)
```


- (you can always override these for individual chunks)

# YOUR TURN

class: center, middle

## In the `\data\` folder, you will find a dataset called `wine_dataset`. 

## Create a beautiful presentation in R Markdown that addresses the questions:  
* How do chemical qualities differ between red and white wines?
* What qualities lead to wines being rated well?
