# What is R?

# What is R?

**R** is a programming language designed originally for *statistical analyses*.

--

**R** was created by the **R Core Group** in 1997.

(https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)[https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html]

--

This group of 20-ish volunteers are the *only* people who can change the base (built-in) functionality of **R**.



---
# What is R?


**R**'s **strengths** are...

--

... handling data with lots of **different types** of variables.

--

... making nice and complex data **visualizations**.

--

... having cutting-edge statistical **methods** available to users.

---
# What is R?


**R**'s **weaknesses** are...

--

... performing non-analysis programming tasks. (*python*, *ruby*, ...)


--

... efficient numerical computation. (*matlab*, *C*, ...)

--

... not a simple tool for all audiences (*SPSS*, *SAS*(?), ...)

# But wait!

---
# Packages

The heart and soul of **R** is **packages**.

--

These are "extra" sets of code that add new functionality to R when installed.

--

If it weren't for packages, we'd still be in 1997!

---

# Open-Source

Importantly, **R** is *open-source*.

--

There is no company that owns **R**, like there is for SAS or Matlab.

(Python is also open-source!)

--

This means nobody can sell their **R** code!

--

* (but you can sell "helpers" like **RStudio**)

--

* (and you can keep code **private** within an organization or company)

--

**Packages are created by users like you and me!**

---
# Open Source

Being a good open-source citizen means...

--

... sharing your code publicly when possible. (GitHub!)

--

... contributing to public projects and packages, as you are able.

--

... creating your own packages, if you can.

--

... using **R** for ethical and respectful projects.

# Try it: Plotting

**If you are brand new to R:** 

Find a partner and through this exercise:  https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1

**If you are familiar with R, but not ggplot:**

Install and load the `ggplot2` package.

Read [Chapter 3 of R for DS through 3.6.1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html). (try code as you go!)

**If you are already familiar with R and ggplot:**

Skim Chapter 3 to make sure you are comfortable with everything.


**When you are finished:** 

You may leave OR work on Lab 0 OR do the reading assignment for Weds.
